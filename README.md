## About:

<img src = "https://i.imgur.com/TWScYU9.png" width = 960 height = 540>


This is a Platformer/Shooter video game, made in Python. The engine is able to handle a lot of tasks including: 

* Displaying sprites and updating them.
* Displaying an interactive parallax background.
* Displaying different animations (idle, moving, jumping...).
* Playing sounds and music.
* Displaying interactive Buttons that can be linked to different actions.
* Displaying a User Interface (Health, Ammunition, Level Timer and other stuff).
* Displaying interactive enemies and updating them (they can shoot, be shot at and patrol).
* Displaying particles & different effects (explosion, shooting and jumping).
* Handling level transitions and level restarts.
* Editing levels using a custom integrated level editor (levels can be saved and played instantly).
* Supporting multiple game resolutions.
* Enabling or disabling certain features (effects).
* And a few more minor features...

This project is no longer in-development.
